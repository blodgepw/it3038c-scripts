# Final Project 
*This is my final project for my Scripting Language class*

For my final project, I wanted to do something different then my first two projects which was building a calculator using python. I used the calculator as inspiration to create a game for my final project. It is a number guessing game where the user has to guess the correct number between 1 and 10. If the user is wrong, the code will provide hints until the user is correct. The game offers a high score too. 

I have used some sources for inspiration behind the game:
[link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/number-guessing-game-in-python/)
[link](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/code-snippets-source-code/python-guessing-game)

Run this program using python3
**Type python --version** to ensure which version you have on Windows.

Go to the FinalProject directory and run the program using:
*python final.py*

The game will then start.

It will prompt the user for their name and then ask if they would like to play the game.
The user will then guess a number between 1-10 and, based on the output, the game will either give hints or prompt the user that it was correct. The game features a high score feature for a little competition. 

*The game should handle any errors the user prompts at it.*
