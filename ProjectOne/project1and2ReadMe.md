# Project One

*This is my first Project. I have created a simple calculator*

For my first project, I have created a calculator that is able to do the four operations of math. I did this because I thought it would be neat to create a calculator since I only use one on my phone.

I have used some sources in order to help me complete this project:
[link](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-make-a-calculator-program-in-python-3)
[link](https://commonmark.org/help/)

Run this program using Python3. 

**Type python --version** to ensure which version you have on Windows.

Go to the ProjectOne folder and run the program using:
*python project1.py*

An example output would be:
*"What operation would you like to use (+,-,*,/):*
*What is your first number?*
*What is your second number?*
*Answer*

# Project Two

*This is my second project*

For my first project, I decided to create a very basic calculator. However, students need a much more complex calculator in order to accomplish there schoolwork. Many classes require advanced calculators instead of the basic ones. I decided to implement "scipy" into my original calculator to add the operations of sin, cosine, and exponents to the 10th power.

I have used one source to help with the completion of this project:

Run this program using python3.

**Type python --version** to ensure which version you have on Windows.

Go to the ProjectOne folder and run the program using:
*python project2.py*

*This will include the original calculator from Project One and modifications for special functions*

An example output would be:
*"What operation would you like to use (+,-,*,/,exp,cos,sin):*
*What is your first number?*
*What is your second number?*
*Answer*

**When using "exp, cos, or sin", use the "first number" as your integer. Please input "0" in the second number slot in order for the function to work properly. Cos = Cosine of a degree, Sin = sine of a degree, Exp = a number to the 10th power (for this specific calculator).**
