# Project One

*This is my first Project. I have created a simple calculator*

For my first project, I have created a calculator that is able to do the four operations of math. I did this because I thought it would be neat to create a calculator since I only use one on my phone.

I have used some sources in order to help me complete this project:
[link](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-make-a-calculator-program-in-python-3)
[link](https://commonmark.org/help/)

Run this program using Python3. 

**Type python --version** to ensure which version you have on Windows.

Go to the ProjectOne folder and run the program using:
*python project1.py*

An example output would be:
*"What operation would you like to use (+,-,*,/):*
*What is your first number?*
*What is your second number?*
